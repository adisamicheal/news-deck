# news-deck
The News Deck app parses news from an XML link using rss-parser.

The Fetch API was used which makes an HTTP request to servers from web browsers.

This is a pet project for explorinng the effectieness of the fetch api.

SPOILER ALERT: If you are opening this on a browser that has a CORS extension on, you might get a CORS error. (working to see if this can be fixed on the FE, your contributions are welcome)
